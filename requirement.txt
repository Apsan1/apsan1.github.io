Overview:
You must develop a personal website about yourself or something related to yourself! The website should provide internet users with information about you, such as your hobbies and work experience, or you could create a site about something relevant to you, such as your mother and father's business, or the band you are in, or the high school football team you were on, or a favorite sports person or team or musical group, or how to cook...etc. We are quite accommodating in terms of the main content of your website, however please ensure that:

there is a component about you (it somehow must be relevant to you)
it must be a NEW site that you built for this course(i.e. it can NOT be a site you designed a year ago).
all the pages fit together. There is a CLEAR THEME that connects all the pages so that visitors to your site can tell by looking at your home page what your site is all about.

Build a website with the following criteria:
Web pages:
Home page plus at least FIVE additional web pages, one of which must be your references page. So you must have a home page + four more pages + a reference page. (i.e. each page should have 6 links/buttons on the page)
Your home page/start page must be called index.html. The file namehtml must be in lowercase, thus you should have a file called index.html.
Use your creativity to layout your website with unique link categories based on your personal experiences. For example you might have links such as "Hobbies", "Family", "Education", etc.
You decide on content organization and you must create the link categories you feel are appropriate
Navigational structure (i.e. links and link layout):Remember to be consistent on each page and make sure your links are easy to navigate through your entire website not just the home page
References Webpage:In the references page, place the following
The VERY first line of the references page must be:
"This website was created by Your First Name, Your Last Name (your userid)"
For example: "This website was created by John Smith (jsmit72)"
Then include references to:
any graphics you did NOT create yourself
any typed content you obtained from another site
any sound/movie clips you used that were not written/created by you
REFERENCES TO YOUR ORIGINAL NATIVE FILES (your banner.psd file, your animation.fla file, etc.... )
