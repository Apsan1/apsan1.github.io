            <h3>My education</h3> <br> <br>
            <p>I started my education when I was 2.5 years old from 2008 to 2013
                as I skipped 3rd grade and went to 4th grade directly. Then I went
                to RIBS school for my further studies, and I passed my SEE from RIBS
                school I studied there for 5 years (2014 to 2020). Then for my high
                school, I went to Trinity International SS & College and passed my
                high school from there and then joined Herald College Kathmandu in
                2022 for my bachelor's degree.</p>

            <h3>How I learned programming</h3> <br> <br>
            <p> I learned C programming in grades 11 and 12 in high school
                as I took Computer Science as a major subject in the science
                stream. C programming was really hard to understand as I had
                a gap of 2 years as I didn't get to read computer as a subject
                in grades 9 and 10. I was also taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                and PHP in grade 12 in a very basic form. <br> <br>
                During the gap after the 12th exam, I did self-study on website
                design along with learning new methods and ways to do HTML and
                CSS utilizing my time. I sharpened my video editing skills and
                photoshop skill. I studied ancient history and religion and
                their effects on the development of civilization. I made a
                website for Siddhi Ganesh Driving Institute and will be launching
                it when the client is happy with its final result. I also managed
                the mail; Excel sheets and Document layouts also created a concept
                logo for Jwala Devi Multipurpose Cooperative.
