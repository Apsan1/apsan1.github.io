            <li>Website for driving institute</li> <br> 
            <p>This is the first project I got as a task from my father to me 
                to make a website for his driving institute so that it could be
                more easier for the customers and himself to interact and 
                provide and recieve updates as well as new information.<br>
                This is going to be finished and only few things are left to 
                update including some videos of the institute itself.

            <li>Book</li> <br> 
            <p> I have been writing a book which is based on my research 
                as I am interested on theology I have been exploring the rural
                areas of Nepal and finding more unbelievable and unexpected
                things. <br> 
                As an information I can only say that,
                those traditions and beliefs we have been starting to ignore
                have already started to come to us back again with more 
                power and influence.

            <li>Talk Show</li> <br>
        <p> My vision on this show is to enlighten the current generation of
            students and society about the culture and traditions which were
            left by our ancestors and to provide a platform where local people 
            get a chance to share their thoughts and life as a whole which could
            provide the viewers knowledge like how the world really is, how to
            survive in different situations,etc more like to develop a moral from
            a person's life.

        <li>Athena Voice Assistant</li>
        <p> This is a project I have been working on for a while now and I am
            still working on it. This is a voice assistant which is based on 
            python and it is still in development phase. <br>
            We can use this voice assistant to do various tasks like opening
            applications, searching on google, playing music, etc. I have also 
            made a website for the voice assistant with the general information as well
            as the installation guides. You can vist it here:
